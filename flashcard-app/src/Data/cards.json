            "answer": "A callback is a function that gets passed into another function as an argument where it is executed when the parent function wants it to be executed. Callbacks are essential to async programming, because they tell a function what to do once it's done with a task."

            "question": "What is asyncronous JavaScript?",
            "answer": "Step two will be performed even if step one isn't finished. Async programming basically allows other operations to continue before one operation has completed (aka, retrieving data from a database)."

            "answer": "The client (or browser) makes a request, and the request is received by the server. The server may have to get something from a database, but basically it returns the user back with some sort of information/resource."

            "answer": "This method offers a way to run JavaScript code after the DOM is fully loaded and safe to manipulate. All jQuery events/functions should occur at this point."

            "answer": "All JavaScript values, except primitives (string, undefined, null, Boolean, number) are objects. Objects are technically varibales, but they can contain many values. Basically, objects are just collections of named values."

            "answer": "Content Delivery Network. CDNs put web content closer to the user, which means faster load times. A website is hosted in a data center. With CDN, one has access to a global network of servers that host content physically closer to visitors."
