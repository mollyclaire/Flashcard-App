# Flashcard-App
A simple app created with React and Firebase. 

## How to Use
Simply draw a card to receive a new question. Hover over the card to see the answer on the back! If using mobile, click the card to see the back.

## Future Development
As of now, the questions and answers are hardcoded into a database (using Firebase). In the future, I hope to integrate a user form where the user can enter their own questions and answers.
